/*1.In this exercise, you will create a class called MyStringList that will be a
 *  “growable” array for Strings. In fact, you will implement this class by having a
 *   private array strArray of Strings in the background, but a user will not know about
 *    your implementation. A user will know only that you will provide the ability for the 
 *    user to add, remove

2.Create an abstract class ‘Animals’ with two abstract methods ‘cats’ and ‘dogs’.
 Now create a class ‘Cats’ with a method ‘cats’ which prints
  “Cats meow” and a class ‘Dogs’ with a method ‘dogs’ which prints “Dogs bark”,
   both inheriting the class ‘Animals’. 
Now create an object for each of the subclasses and call their respective methods.*/

	/*3.awet(Instructor) [8:00 PM]
			A university department consists of professors and secretaries. 
			Each professor and each secretary has a name, a salary, and a hire date. Use inheritance and polymorphism to create an application that represents the department and its professors and secretaries as objects, and provides a test class that creates 3 professors and 2 secretaries, and then outputs the combined total of 
			all of their salaries.*/
